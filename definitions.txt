Let's have some fun.
Definitions for the database filtering project.

Every request shall have the following properties:
{
	"filterId": "[id]", -> unique identifier used to identify with the API model configuration
	"condition": "[comparator]", => =, <, >, between...
	"value": "[value]", => the actual value to compare with the data on the database,
}

Every model shall be defined with the following properties
{
	"acceptedComparators": [], => vector with the accepted comparators (<, >, =, between...)
	"dataType": "[type]", => string with the data type used to compare with this item on the database
	"table": "[complete table name, eg: public.clients]",
	"propertyName": "[name of property to be compared on database, eg: age]",
	"conflictsWith": [] => vector with the name of tables that this particular filter can conflict,
}
